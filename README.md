# Country Top Trumps
Think you know the world? Here's a chance to play top trumps with country data.

# How's it work?
Select a full, half, third or quarter pack size and randomly draw the deck. Using stats from each country, such as area, borders, population try and win the country card from the opposition until you've got them all!

Your high score will be saved so you can keep learning and come back to try and beat it!
